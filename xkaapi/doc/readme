This is a fork from the OPENDE subversion repository (1827).
It annotates some parts of the code for further compilation
by the KACC compiler.

It assumes you have the XKAAPI runtime and the KACC compiler
installed in:
$HOME/install/xkaapi_rose

To compile, first run:
$> sh autogen.sh in the opende topmost directory

It creates the configure script. Then:
$> ./xkaapi/scripts/do_configure.sh

At the moment, the demo_step example is used. To make it:
$> ./xkaapi/scripts/do_make.sh
To run it:
$> ./xkaapi/scripts/do_run.sh
